4. **Efficient Data Management**
   - One-click import of submissions to spreadsheet

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **State Management**: Zustand store for form and submission data
- **Components**:
  - `FormBuilder`: Main form creation interface
  - `FormViewer`: Public form display and submission
  - `FormSubmissionsView`: Submission management interface
- **Validation**: HTML5 validation with custom rules
- **Routing**: Dedicated routes for form viewing

### Data Flow
1. User creates form from spreadsheet columns
2. Form configuration saved in Zustand store
3. Public URL generated for sharing
4. Submissions collected and stored
5. Data imported back to spreadsheet on demand

## Testing the Form Feature

1. **Create a Form**:
   - Navigate to any spreadsheet (e.g., `/spreadsheet/new`)
   - Click the "Generate Form" button in the toolbar
   - Configure your form fields and settings
   - Click "Save" and then "Share Form" to copy the form URL

2. **Access the Form**:
   - Open the copied form URL in a new tab or incognito window
   - The form will load with all visible fields
   - Submit data through the form

3. **View Submissions**:
   - Return to the spreadsheet
   - Click "View Submissions" button (appears after creating a form)
   - Select submissions and click "Add Selected to Sheet" to import them

## Technical Notes

- Forms are persisted in localStorage using Zustand persist middleware
- Form URLs follow the pattern: `/form/{timestamp}`
- Hidden fields are excluded from public forms but visible in admin views
- All form data is validated both client-side (HTML5) and in the validation logic

## Future Enhancements
- File upload fields
- Conditional logic (show/hide fields)
- Multi-page forms
- Form templates
- Advanced analytics
- Webhook integrations
- PDF export of submissions
